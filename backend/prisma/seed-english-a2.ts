    question: 'Choose the correct article: I need ___ information about the course.',
    options: ['A) a', 'B) an', 'C) the', 'D) no article'],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "'Information' is an uncountable noun, meaning it cannot be counted individually and has no plural form. Uncountable nouns don't use 'a/an' and are treated as singular. Common uncountable nouns: water, money, advice, furniture, homework, music, news. Correct: 'I need information' (not 'an information' or 'informations')."

    question: 'Complete with the correct article: Can you pass me ___ sugar, please?',
    options: ['A) a', 'B) an', 'C) the', 'D) no article'],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "'The' is the definite article used when both speaker and listener know exactly which item is being discussed. In this context, 'the sugar' refers to a specific sugar container that both people can see or know about. We use 'the' with: specific items, unique things (the sun), superlatives (the best), and when something has been mentioned before."

    options: ['A) I bought a bread at the store.', 'B) I bought some bread at the store.', 'C) I bought breads at the store.', 'D) I bought the bread at the store.'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "'Bread' is an uncountable noun representing a substance rather than individual items. We cannot say 'a bread' or 'breads'. Use quantifiers like 'some', 'much', 'a lot of', or specific units like 'a loaf of bread', 'a slice of bread'. Other uncountable food items: rice, pasta, cheese, meat, milk."

    options: ['A) a, a', 'B) an, some', 'C) a, some', 'D) an, a'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Use 'an' before singular countable nouns starting with vowel sounds (a, e, i, o, u). 'Apple' starts with /Ã¦/ sound, so 'an apple'. 'Milk' is uncountable, so use 'some milk' (not 'a milk'). Remember: it's about sound, not spelling - 'an hour' (silent h), 'a university' (sounds like 'you')."

    correct: 1,
    explanation: "'Any' is used in negative sentences and questions with both countable and uncountable nouns. In negatives: 'There isn't any coffee' (uncountable), 'There aren't any apples' (countable). In questions: 'Is there any milk?' 'Are there any cookies?' Use 'some' in positive statements and offers."

    section: 'Articles & Countable/Uncountable Nouns',
    question: 'Complete the sentence: How ___ money do you have?',
    options: ['A) many', 'B) much', 'C) some', 'D) any'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Use 'How much' with uncountable nouns and 'How many' with countable nouns. 'Money' is uncountable (we count dollars, euros, etc., not 'moneys'). Examples: How much water? How much time? How much sugar? vs. How many books? How many people? How many cars? This is a fundamental grammar rule for questions about quantity."
